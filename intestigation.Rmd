**Note:** You can use this file as you 'working document' where you can try out various investigation ideas and keep notes about your findings. How you use and structure this file is up to you. It is recommended that you keep notes about what you are investigating and what you find as this will make the process of creating your presentation and report easier. Please note that you _do not_ need to submit this file as part of your group project.

Summarising wait time over 4 hours based on location of treatment and percentage within 4 hours by year

This allows us to see that the total number of visits under 4 hours has also decreased since the beginning of the data set, bottoming out in early-to-mid 2020 and staying chaotic but generally low until today.

The surrounding weeks appear to have similarly low values, signifying that this especially low amount of attendances under 4 hours may have been part of some greater trend.
